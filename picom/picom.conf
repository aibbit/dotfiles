# WINDOW-TYPE
# ---
#
# 'WINDOW_TYPE' is one of the 15 window types defined in EWMH standard:
#
#     "unknown",
#     "desktop",
#     "dock",
#     "toolbar",
#     "menu",
#     "utility",
#     "splash",
#     "dialog",
#     "normal",
#     "dropdown_menu",
#     "popup_menu",
#     "tooltip",
#     "notification",
#     "combo",
#     "dnd".
#
# Following per window-type options are available:
#
#     fade, shadow:
#     Controls window-type-specific shadow and fade settings.
#
#     opacity:
#     Controls default opacity of the window type.
#
#     focus:
#     Controls whether the window of this type is to be always considered focused.
#     (By default, all window types except "normal" and "dialog" has this on.)
#
#     full-shadow:
#     Controls whether shadow is drawn under the parts of the window that you normally won't be able to see.
#     Useful when the window has parts of it transparent, and you want shadows in those areas.
#
#     clip-shadow-above:
#     Controls wether shadows that would have been drawn above the window should be clipped.
#     Useful for dock windows that should have no shadow painted on top.
#
#     redir-ignore:
#     Controls whether this type of windows should cause screen to become redirected again after been unredirected.
#     If you have unredir-if-possible set, and doesn't want certain window to cause unnecessary screen redirection,
#     you can set this to `true`.
